## University Projects

### Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions with Machine Learning

The objective of this work was to develop machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees) that could accurately predict adverse drug reactions using the SIDER and OFFSIDES databases and Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost, rdkit, imblearn).

## Kaggle Competitions

### Kannada MNIST

**Placement: 109/1214, Top 9%**

The goal of this competition was to provide a simple extension to the classic MNIST competition. Instead of using Arabic numerals, it used a recently-released dataset of Kannada digits. 

I used a Convolutional Neural Networks, optimized it, used data augmentation, among other techiniques. The final accuracy was 0.9896 in the private leaderboard and 0.9886 in the public leaderboard.

## Kaggle Datasets

### Students Performance in Exams

A quick EDA and statistical analysis in a kaggle dataset contaning marks secured by the students in various subjects. The main objective of this analysis was to understand which factors could affect these grades.

### Zomato Bangalore Restaurants

This work consists in a EDA and a Regression Task using a kaggle dataset containing information about restaurants in Bangalore. The main objective of this analysis was to understand which factors could affect the rate of a restaurant and if this can be predicted within a small margin of error.
