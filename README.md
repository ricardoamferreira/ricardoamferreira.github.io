## University Projects

### Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions with Machine Learning

The objective of this work was to develop machine learning methods that could accurately predict adverse drug reactions using the SIDER and OFFSIDEs databases.

## Kaggle Datasets

### Students Performance in Exams

A quick EDA and statistical analysis in a kaggle dataset contaning marks secured by the students in various subjects. The main objective of this analysis was to understand which factors could affect these grades.

### Zomato Bangalore Restaurants
#### In progress

This work will consist in a EDA and a Regression Task using a kaggle dataset containing information about restaurants in Bangalore. The main objective of this analysis was to understand which factors could affect the rate of a restaurant and if this can be predicted within a small margin of error.
